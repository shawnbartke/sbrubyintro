# Write if they return true or false or raise an error.

(32 * 4) >= "129"    # error because "129" is a string not an integer
847 == '874'         # false because they are not equal. Tricky after doing previous one is interger other is a string
'847' < '846'        # false
'847' > '846'        # True
'847' > '8478'       # false
'847' < '8478'       # true
